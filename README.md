# Plant-Leaf-Classification-And-Disease-Detection
Project using Deep Learning Technique/Neural Network, Image processing and Python Libraries

*DESCRIPTION*

Our Indian trademark highly depends on agriculture. Since 80% of the people are going witha griculture, it is important to increase crop/plant productivity. But with time passing by, plants are affected with various kinds of diseases, which cause great harm to agricultural plantproductions. Besides that, many countries economy greatly depends on agricultural productivity, and it is also a need for a country to attain agricultural productivity. Detection of plant disease through automatic technique is beneficial as it requires a large amount of work of monitoring in the big farm of crops, and at a very early stage, it detects symptoms of diseases that appear on plant leaves. Also, plant identification based on the leaf is becoming one of the most important and popular trends. Each leaf carries unique information that can be used in the identification of plants. A system is developed to classify and detect plant leaf diseases using deep learning techniques. In our work, the Kaggle Dataset of leaf images is used, and we have taken specific types of plants which includes corn, pepper, potatoes, and few types of fruits as they are the most common types of plants in the world. The Dataset contains 77644 images of leaves including the diseased leaves. In the identification of plants, the leaf images need to be pre-processed accordingly to extract the various critical features. We used the convolutional neural network (CNN), through which plant leaves are classified into 23 different classes that include 8 different plants, 5 types of Fruits, and 3 types of Vegetables. As a result, we obtained excellent accuracy in training and testing were, we got an accuracy of (93.29%) for training, and (92.49%) for testing for all data set that were used.


*TEECHNOLOGY USED:*
Deep Learning Technique/Neural Network, Image processing and Python Libraries

*FEATURES*
The main objective of our project is to apply and implement the CNN algorithm to identify the crop/plant is healthy or not and detect the diseased part in the plant.
